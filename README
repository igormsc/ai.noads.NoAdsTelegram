NoAdsTelegram

This Xposed module is a tiny rebellion — a way to claw back some of that original spirit of freedom promised by Telegram at the beginning, one hook at a time.

What it does

    🚫 Kills sponsored messages – no more "promoted channels" in your chat list.

    🎥 Stops video ads – watch those stories and videos ad‑free.

    🔁 Enables forwarding & saving – even on content that was locked down.

    💾 Lets you save stories – because you might actually want to keep them.

    🗑️ Prevents message deletion (a.k.a. recall) – if someone said it, they said it.

    👻 Optionally hides the whole stories section – out of sight, out of mind.

    📌 Hides pinned messages – clean up those chat headers, one less distraction.

    🌐 Hides the translate dialog – no more "Translate this message" popups cluttering your view.

    🎛️ Everything is configurable – you decide which parts of this unholy magic to enable.

Compatibility

	Works with the official Telegram app v12.4.1.

Installation

    Install the module in your Xposed framework (LSPosed recommended).

    Enable the module for org.telegram.messenger.

    Reboot (or force-stop Telegram) and enjoy.

    Look for the NoAdsTelegram icon in your app drawer (or system settings) – that's where you tweak the hooks.
