NoAdsTelegram

This Xposed module is a tiny rebellion — a way to claw back some of that original spirit of freedom promised by Telegram at the beginning, one hook at a time.

What it does

    🔁 Enable forwarding & saving – even on content that was locked down.

    💾 Enable saving stories – download and keep stories for later.

    🚫 Disable sponsored messages – no more "promoted channels" cluttering your chat list.

    🎥 Disable video ads – watch videos and stories ad‑free.

    🗑️ Disable message deletion – if someone said it, they said it. (a.k.a. anti‑recall)

    🔄 Disable channel switching – prevent accidental channel changes via swipe or tap.

    👻 Hide stories section – out of sight, out of mind.

    📌 Hide pinned messages – clean up those chat headers, one less distraction.

    🌐 Hide translate dialog – no more "Translate this message" popups.

    🔇 Hide mute button – remove the mute notification button from chats.

    ⬇️ Hide bottom overlay – hide the media/attachment overlay when you don't need it.

    👤 Disable swipe profile – prevent accidentally closing the profile by swiping (keep it open).

    📱 Disable swipe channel – disable swiping gestures on channels (for those with twitchy thumbs).

    🎛️ Everything is configurable – you decide which parts of this unholy magic to enable.


Compatibility

	Works with the official Telegram app v12.4.1.

Installation

    Install the module in your Xposed framework (LSPosed recommended).

    Enable the module for org.telegram.messenger.

    Reboot (or force-stop Telegram) and enjoy.

    Look for the NoAdsTelegram icon in your app drawer (or system settings) – that's where you tweak the hooks.
