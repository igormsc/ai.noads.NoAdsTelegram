NoAdsTelegram

This Xposed module is a tiny rebellion — a way to claw back some of that original spirit of freedom promised by Telegram at the beginning, one hook at a time.

What it does

🚫 Ads? What ads?

    Disable sponsored messages – no more "promoted channels" in your chat list.

    Disable video ads – watch videos ad‑free.

💬 Messaging – take back control

    Enable forwarding & saving – even on content that was locked down.

    Disable message deletion – if someone said it, they said it. (a.k.a. anti‑recall)

    Disable chat deletion – stop chats from disappearing… but beware: if you delete a chat with this on, it might just come back after a restart. (Spoopy!)

🔒 Secret Chat – now less secret (for you)

    Disable secret chat message deletion – keep those ephemeral messages forever.

    Disable self‑destruct – self‑destruct timers now hit zero and just… stop. Like a movie cliffhanger.

    Enable secret media save – save photos and videos from secret chats. Shhh.

📸 Stories – your way

    Enable saving stories – download and keep stories for later.

    Hide stories section – out of sight, out of mind.

🎨 UI – declutter your Telegram

    Disable channel switching – prevent accidental channel changes via swipe or tap.

    Hide pinned messages – clean up those chat headers.

    Hide translate dialog – no more "Translate this" popups.

    Hide mute button – remove the mute notification button from chats.

    Hide bottom overlay – hide the bottom overlay when you don't need it.

    Disable swipe profile – stop accidentally closing the profile by swiping (keep it open).

    Disable swipe channel – disable swiping gestures on channels (for those with twitchy thumbs).

👤 Privacy – go ghost

    Hide typing – stop showing "typing…" to others. Your thoughts, your secret.

🎛️ Everything is configurable

    All these options are neatly grouped in the NoAdsTelegram settings – – you decide which experiments to run.

Compatibility

    Works with the official Telegram app (tested on v12.4.1)

Installation

    Install the module in your Xposed framework (LSPosed recommended).

    Enable the module for org.telegram.messenger.

    Reboot (or force-stop Telegram) and enjoy.

    Look for the NoAdsTelegram icon in your app drawer (or system settings) – that's where you tweak the hooks.
